#### EXHSET

Grammar and complexity：


> EXHSET <key> <field> <value> [EX time] [EXAT time] [PX time] [PXAT time] [NX/XX] [VER/ABS version] 
> time complexity：O(1)

Command Description：  
> Insert a field into the TairHash specified by the key. If TairHash does not exist, it will automatically create one, and if the field already exists, its value will be overwritten. When inserting, you can use EX/EXAT/PX/PXAT to set the expiration time for the field. When the field expires, it will be deleted actively (active expire) or passive (passivity expire). If the NX option is specified, the insertion will be successful only when the field does not exist. Similarly, if the XX option is specified, the insertion will be successful only when the field exists. If the VER parameter is specified, the version number carried by the VER must be consistent with the current version number of the field before it can be inserted successfully. If the field does not exist or the current version of the field is 0, no check is performed, and the insertion can always be successful. The ABS parameter is used to forcibly set the version number for the field, regardless of the current version number of the field, it can always be inserted successfully, and the version number specified by ABS cannot be 0. This command will trigger the passive elimination check of the field 


parameter：

> key: The key used to find the TairHash
> field: An element in TairHash
> value: The value corresponding to an element in TairHash
> EX: The relative expiration time of the specified field, in seconds, 0 means no expiration
> EXAT: Specify the absolute expiration time of the field, in seconds, 0 means no expiration 
> PX: The relative expiration time of the specified field, in milliseconds, 0 means no expiration
> PXAT: Specify the absolute expiration time of the field, in milliseconds, 0 means no expiration
> NX/XX: NX means inserting is allowed only when the field to be inserted does not exist, XX means inserting is allowed only when the field exists
> VER/ABS: VER means that the setting is allowed only when the specified version is consistent with the current version of the field. If the version specified by VER is 0, it means that no version check will be performed. ABS means that the version number is forced to be set and modified regardless of the current version of the field.


Return：

> When a new field is created and the value is successfully set for it, the command returns 1, if the field already exists and successfully overwrites the old value, the command returns 0; if XX is specified and the field does not exist, it returns -1, if NX is specified and the field is already If exists, return -1; if VER is specified and the version does not match the current version, the exception message "ERR update version is stale" is returned

If VERParameter is specified, the version number carried by VER must be consistent with the current version number of the field before it can be set successfully, or if the version number carried by VERParameter is 0, no version verification is performed. ABSParameter is used to force the field to set the version number, regardless of the current version number of the field, it can always be inserted successfully. At the same time, the current version number of the field is set to the version number specified by ABS. Note that the version number cannot be 0.

If you only want to return the number of fields that have not expired, you can bring a noexpParameter at the end. Note that with this parameter, the RT of exhlen will be affected by the size of exhash (because it needs to be traversed), and exhlen will not trigger the field Is eliminated, it just filters out the expired fields

#### EXHSCAN


Grammar and complexity：


> EXHSCAN <key> <op> <subkey> [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]  
> time complexity：O(1)、O(N)  



Command Description：


> Scan the TairHash specified by the key, the scanning mode op can be >, >=, <, <=, ==, ^, $, and the result set can be filtered according to the pattern specified by MATCH while scanning, and the COUNT pair list can also be used The number of scans is limited. If not specified, the default value is 10. The SCAN/HSCAN of TairHash and Redis Yunsheng Hash are not the same. It does not have the concept of cursor. On the contrary, users can use subkey to directly locate the starting position of the scan. Compared with the cursor which is meaningless to business, subkey is more business-friendly . At the same time, the native Redis Hash scanning algorithm may return a large number of scanned fields when rehashing, but TaiHash does not have this problem. During the asymptotic scanning process, regardless of whether the field in TaiHash increases or decreases, the scanned fields are already scanned. The field will never be scanned and returned again.


Parameter：


> key: The key used to find the TairHash
> op: Used to locate the starting point of the scan, which can be:> (start from the first field greater than subkey), >= (start from the first field position greater than or equal to subkey), <(start from the first field less than subkey ), <= (start from the first field less than or equal to subkey), == (start from the first field equal to subkey), ^ (start from the first field), \$ (start from the last field)   
> subkey: The key used to search for the starting position of the scan. When op is ^ or $, the value will be ignored
> MATCH: Rules for filtering scan results
> COUNT: It is used to specify the number of fields in a single scan. Note that COUNT only represents the number of feilds of TairHash scanned each time. It does not mean that COUNT field result sets will be returned in the end. The size of the result set depends on the current fields in TaiHash. The number and whether to specify MATCH for filtering depends. The default value of COUNT is 10



Return：


> Returns an array with two elements. The first element of the array is a string, which represents the next field to be scanned after the end of this scan. If there is no field to scan after the end of this scan, then the element is empty String. The second array element is still an array, and the array contains all the field/values that are iterated this time. If an empty TairHash is found or TairHash does not exist, then both array elements are empty.
